When I was in third year, we had a unit known as 'Server Administration' and one of the group projects we had, was to basically set up a static website with a functioning domain. Now, I'm probably sure you know what that means, but if you don't :chaching, buy a domain cause they ain't free. Now some smart people thought of using Github Pages but I don't remember anyone ever doing it. Maybe they did, I just didn't see it. Now, was I inspired by their ideas? Yes! Did I open one at that time? Nope!

Fast forward to 2024, I am now a FOURTH year (can you feel the pressure of being a fourth year while reading this?) and its a new semester, meaning new units, one particular one called Distributed Systems. One of the things we were taught was [RAFT](https://raft.github.io)( an algorithm used in distributed systems to achieve consensus) and its website+publications was hosted as a GitHub Pages website. The thing that caught my eye was how simple it was. It was just so clean and simple that I immediately got inspired to make a GitHub Pages website again! Did I do it? Nope! I mean, in my defense, I was a fourth year struggling to solidify my final project ideas before starting my documentation. I am proud to say that I made it through Distributed Systems without needing to distribute myself(get it?) and even made a pretty good final year project!!

Now, did I ever make that GitHub Pages website? I mean, you are reading this from it! I finally managed to make one after hours of trying to figure out Jekyll. Although thousands of kilometres from home, I hope I have a fun time using this page and as an added bonus, I hope you have a fun time reading it too. As the French would say, au revoir!!!!!
